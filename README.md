## Introduction

Don't like to keep opening a browser or visiting a site to generate avatars of Habbo players? You're in luck! This program allows you to get an avatar image of a user, without even visiting a webpage directly once.

## Usage

The usage of this program is quite simple.

The Habbo name field has to be filled in with the name of the Habbo user. You then have to select which hotel they are from, with "International" being Habbo.COM.

You can also customise the pose the avatar is in, with the gesture field, and action options. Finally, you can also specify the size of the image to be generated in, before generating the image.

Afterwards, you can either save the image, or reset if unsatisfied.

## Installation

This was coded with Visual Studio 2010, using .NET Framework 4 Client Profile, and should thus be usable with any version of Visual Studio 2010 and up, as well as SharpDevelop. Compatibility wise, it should present no challenges in being converted to use a newer version of the .NET Framework.
